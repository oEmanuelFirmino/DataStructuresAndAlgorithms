## Overview

This repository demonstrates various **algorithms** and **data structures** commonly used in computer science. It includes implementations of **searching algorithms** (such as Binary Search, Linear Search, Exponential Search, and Jump Search) and foundational **data structures** like Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Trees.

Each algorithm and data structure implementation is accompanied by a performance analysis, including a comparison of the number of operations performed and the time taken for execution.

## Search Algorithms

The repository features implementations of the following search algorithms:

- **Linear Search**
- **Binary Search**
- **Exponential Search**
- **Jump Search**

These algorithms are commonly used to locate elements within arrays, and their performance varies depending on the type of data being searched.

## Data Structures

The repository includes implementations of fundamental data structures:

- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Trees**

These structures are essential for organizing and storing data in ways that allow for efficient access and modification.

## Complexity Analysis

For each algorithm and data structure, time and space complexity are analyzed using **Big O Notation**. This helps assess the efficiency of the algorithm in terms of the input size.
